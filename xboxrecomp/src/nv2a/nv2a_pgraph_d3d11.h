/*
 * NV2A PGRAPH → D3D11 Translator
 *
 * Intercepts NV2A push buffer method calls and translates them into
 * D3D8→D3D11 rendering commands. This is the core of the GPU translation
 * layer for Xbox static recompilation.
 *
 * The push buffer contains NV2A Kelvin (NV097) methods:
 *   - Surface/viewport setup → D3D11 render target + viewport
 *   - Render state (blend, depth, cull) → D3D11 state objects
 *   - Begin/End draw + Inline vertex data → D3D11 DrawPrimitiveUP
 *   - Texture binding → D3D11 shader resource views
 *   - Clear commands → D3D11 ClearRenderTargetView
 *
 * Vertex formats observed in menus:
 *   5 dwords per vertex: float X, float Y, float U, float V, D3DCOLOR
 *   Drawn as TRIANGLE_STRIP (mode 6)
 *
 * This module is designed to be reusable across Xbox recompilation projects.
 * See: https://github.com/sp00nznet/xboxrecomp
